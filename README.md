mimosa-rr
===========

Purely an example `misc` compiler.  You probably don't want to use this in a real app.  Check that, you really don't want to use this in a real app!

To test this out and play with it..

* git clone this repo
* `cd MimosaMiscCompilerExample`
* `mimosa mod:install`
* add `rr` to your list of modules in a mimosa app
* Create a `.rr` file in your assets directory.  Doesn't matter what it contains.
* Run `mimosa watch -s`

Then observe and learn! See how it transforms your input file to different output.  It "compiled" it.

To play with it, simply change the module's code and re-execute `mimosa mod:install`.
